# OSE data science student project: Replication of Angrist et al. (2009)

This repository contains my replication of the results of 
> Angrist et al. (2009). “Incentives and Services For College Achievement: Evidence From  A Randomized Trial". *American Economic Journal: Applied Economics*, 1:1, 136–63.

For optimal results I recommend to clone the repository to your local machine and run the notebook on student_project environment. In order to do so our local machine ideally needs to have Anaconda Navigator. The following badges allow easy access to the project's notebook

## Project overview
Angrist et al. (2009) studies the effect of academic services and financial incentives on not so spectacular students in a randomised trial. As the randomisation is diluted for participation, they employ instrumental variables to estimate the causal effect of the program. They argue for a lasting improvement in academic performance of females due to improved stud habits when services and incentives are combined. I replicate the Table 5, Table 8 and Figure 1 from the paper. In extension, I focus on background variables, visualisation for better understanding and gender participation differences.

    "\n",
    "***Motivation***:\n",
    "The motivation of Angrist et al.(2009) comes from the importance of academic performance, not dropping out from the program and completing on time for post-secondary education experience. Something that many students, particularly ones from low-income families, struggle to achieve. One reason for this is poor study skills. As a response many North American universities offer academic services to improve skills like note taking, time management or goal-setting. However, the non-experimental research on academic support services for college students have found mixed results even though experimental design of the same services on high school students drew a more promising picture. \n",
    "Furthermore to motivate better academic performance merit scholarship have been part of college education for a long time. Although only a small group of spectacular students have benefitted from this financial incentive. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Study Design***: \\\n",
    "Angrist et al. (2009) analysis the results of Student Achievement and Retention (STAR) Demonstration Project. STAR is designed as a randomised evaluation to learn more about the effects of support services and financial incentives on academic performance at a satellite campus of a large Canadian university that is in U.S. terms a large state university with heavily subsidised tuition fees. Students attending are mostly from local area and have similar high school background which eliminate geographic background differences that could arise in the treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Estimation Strategy***:\\\n",
    "Students are randomly allocated into control or one of the treatment groups. Students in a treatment group receive an offer and the have to signed up to be eligible which is not random. In order to estimate the causal impact of financial incentives and academic support services Angrist et al. (2009) use **instrumental variables (IV)**. However, due to the low compliance rate most results reported are **intent-to-treat (ITT)** estimates. The data comes from 1656 full time first year students combining administrative data and survey data which the students took **prior** to the treatment selection.\n",

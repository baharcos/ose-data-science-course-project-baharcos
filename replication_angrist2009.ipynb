    "# 1. Introduction\n",

    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Motivation\n",
    "The motivation of Angrist et al.(2009) comes from the importance of academic performance, not dropping out from the program and completing on time for post-secondary education experience. Something that many students, particularly ones from low-income families, struggle to achieve. One reason for this is poor study skills. As a response many North American universities offer academic services to improve skills like note taking, time management or goal-setting. However, the non-experimental research on academic support services for college students have found mixed results even though experimental design of the same services on high school students drew a more promising picture. \n",
    "Furthermore to motivate better academic performance merit scholarship have been part of college education for a long time. Although only a small group of spectacular students have benefitted from this financial incentive. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Study Design\n",
    "Angrist et al. (2009) analysis the results of Student Achievement and Retention (STAR) Demonstration Project. STAR is designed as a randomised evaluation to learn more about the effects of support services and financial incentives on academic performance at a satellite campus of a large Canadian university that is in U.S. terms a large state university with heavily subsidised tuition fees. Students attending are mostly from local area and have similar high school background which further eliminates geographic background differences that could arise in the treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3 Estimation Strategy\n",
    "Students are randomly allocated into control or one of the treatment groups. Students in a treatment group receive an offer and the have to signed up to be eligible which is not random. In order to estimate the causal impact of financial incentives and academic support services Angrist et al. (2009) use **instrumental variables (IV)**. However, due to the low compliance rate most results reported are **intent-to-treat (ITT)** estimates. The data comes from 1656 full time first year students combining administrative data and survey data which the students took **prior** to the treatment selection.\n",

    "| Combined:sfsp         | Credits earned         | \n",
    "\n",
    "Angrist et al. (2009) use students grades on fall term, first and second year GPA as a direct measure for performance. Although many students take a lighter course load across semesters. To this end, credits earned outcome measures how likely the student is to complete on time hence, the academic performance.\n",
    "Lastly authors look at how effective the treatment is to keep students out of being in probation or withdrawing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.4. Main Findings \n",
    "Main findings of Angrist et al. (2009) are: \n",
    "- Female students are more likely to use the services\n",
    "- Male achievement remained unchanged with the intervention \n",
    "- Services itself failed to attract students\n",
    "- Incentives itself motivated both genders to have better academic performance. However, there was no lasting effect\n",
    "- The combined treatment as well as service treatment had lasting effects even when the treatment was not in place\n",
    "- Female achievement in services combined with financial incentives increased students GPA about 0.35$\\sigma$\n",
    "- The cost of the policy is very small compared to the increase of future income of the students by better academic performance\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.5 Replication Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I replicate Table 5, Table 8 and Figure 1 of Angrist et al. (2009) which I consider as the key results. As an extension I give an extended overview of the data through tables and various plots and do balance checks between groups who are offered a treatment and who actually signed up for the treatment. Section 2 presents the STAR study design and participating students background. I describe the identification strategy of Angrist et al. (2009) to find causal effects in section 3. Section 4 shows my replication results of the paper. In section 5, I conduct balance checks on students participated in the treatment and for assumptions of the IV estimator. Section 6 gives a critical assessment of Angrist et al. (2009) results and concludes."

    "The main goal of the Angrist et al. (2009) is to determine the causal effect of incentives and services on academic performance.\n",
    "In STAR Demonstration project they face the incomplete random assignment challenge to estiamte the true causal effect of the program. The randomised offer do not force students into participate. Students needs to sign-up in order to recieve emails from the program and to be a participant. Sign-up procedure used to determine who is actually motivated to use the program by paying a small cost. However, sign up creates selection bias.  \n",
    "Only people who received an offer can participate in one of the programs and participation is expected to improve academic performance.\n",
    "The first stage is the effect of offer on sign-up rates. Which is by offer how likely you are to sign up This is given by the compliance rate. \n",
    "Second stage is effect of participation on academic performance\n",
    "Reduced form effect can be written as (ITT: effect of offer on academic performance) = effect of offer on sign-up rates x effect of participation on academic performance\n",
    "What we want to find out the effect of participation on academic performance. To do so with the causal specification below, it is possible to use the offer as an instrument as used in Angrist et al. (2009)\n",

Table 5 does not report on control variables even though in the regression code they run the control variables are also included. However, non of them are statistically significant themselves and they are neither jointly significant. The estimates for the treatment change only incrementally without controls.

    "The regression estimates does not give the full insight on how the students for example in the lowest quantile or in the upper quantile in college grades is effected by the program.

The blue line is for control and the orange line is for treatments. The results for males are mixed. While for females in SFP and SFSP groups almost at all data points we see that treatment group do better as can be seen in second and third graph below. "

The only female results are reported in Angrist et al. (2009) Table 8. The reason is that the intervention only had significant causal effects on women. The conrol variable of mothertongue, parent education, number of courses taken and treatment offer are used as instruments to estimate the causal effect of participating in the program."

    "The goal of the STAR demonstration project to learn more about how the academic support services and financial incentives like fellowships improve academic performance in college. The student reports section of Angrist et al. does not mention any student who thinks she is harmed by the program. Even the students who did not meet with their peer advisors said it was nice to know someone was there for them. The facilitated stud group participation was even lower. Angrist et al. argues that that services alone fail to attract students. The authors report that SPP did better in IV-2SLS than in ITT for both men and women. Although it was still statistically insignificant at 10 percent level. They report that this is due to low compliance rate. Another important finding is that even the SFP motivates students, the effect of financial incentive on academic performance fade over time while SFSP has long lasting effects. Angrist et al. (2009) states that services have indeed help students to form better stud habits. Although in order to participate in services, students require additional incentives.\n",

    "The Angrist et al. (2009) reports on modest program costs, arguing that the improved academic performance result in higher future income which can easyly offsett the costs.\n",

    "On final remarks, Angrist et al. (2009) highlights the gender effects and points in out as an area of future study. \n",
    "\n",
    "I took Table 5 on ITT estimates -as it was reported in Angrist et al. (2009) as main result-, table 8 on IV-2SLS results -as all the assumptions to identify the causal effect is of participation using instrumental variable is met and well-established in the paper- and Figure 1 -showing the treatment effect on each data point- as key results for replication.\n",
    "My findings are inline with Angrist et al. (2009). Although I followed a different approach in regression data. I used the same dataset for Table 5 and Table 8. Instead of using the unfiltered data set for Table 8. My estimates for the treatment are more modest yet I argue that they are more robust for comparission of the participation effect with offer effect. It seem to be that authors use the full data set in Table 8 to inflate the results of participation. \n",
    "As the identification assumptions are met and as the gender differences are highlighted very often in the paper, I focused on how different genders behaved in participation in the program in extention.\n"
